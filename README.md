# **Project Report**
## **FinSight - AI document assistant - A Role-Based Access Control System**

## **Project Overview**

This project implements an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system tailored for multi-role enterprise environments. Users can upload documents (Markdown, CSV), and the system retrieves answers based on the user's role. Queries are classified and routed accordingly — SQL-type queries are translated to SQL using an LLM and executed on DuckDB, while RAG-type queries are answered via the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, and responses are enhanced by reranking and evaluated for quality. The architecture includes:

* **Streamlit UI**: for user login, role-based access, and document upload.
* **FastAPI backend**: for business logic, user management, and RAG handling.
* **Query Classifier agent**: to route user queries to the appropriate retrieval mode.
* **SQL Agent**: processes structured data queries using an LLM for translation and DuckDB for execution.
* **RAG Agent**: retrieves and synthesizes responses from unstructured documents using embeddings and LLMs.
* **DuckDB**: for SQL-like queries over structured data (CSV).
* **Chroma vector store**: for dense embedding search (unstructured).
* **Fallback Mechanism**: to ensure graceful degradation when structured query fails.
* **Cohere Reranker**: to ensure better user trust in responses

### **Architecture Overview**

* Combines **structured data querying (SQL)** with **unstructured document retrieval (RAG)**.
* Ensures **high accuracy and flexibility** by selecting the most appropriate engine per query.
* Implements **fallback logic** for robustness — the user always gets a meaningful response.
* This system is designed to intelligently respond to user queries using either **structured SQL** or **unstructured RAG** depending on the nature of the query.

### **End-to-End Flow:**
#### 1. **User Interface Layer**
* A user enters a question through a **Streamlit UI**.
* This query is sent to the **FastAPI backend**, which handles the core logic.

#### 2. **Query Classification**
* The query first reaches a **Query Classifier Agent**, which analyzes it and decides:
  * **Is this a structured query?** (e.g., about data in a table)
  * **Or an unstructured query?** (e.g., asking for procedural guidance)

#### 3. **SQL Agent Path**
* If the classifier determines it's an **SQL-type query**:
  * The query goes to the **SQL Agent**, which uses an **LLM to convert natural language into SQL**.
  * The generated SQL is executed using **DuckDB**, a fast in-process SQL engine.
  * If the query executes successfully, the result is sent back to the user as a **SQL Response**.
    
#### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**
* If the SQL query **fails** or the response is **incomplete**, a **Fallback Trigger** is activated.
* The system automatically reroutes the query to the **RAG Agent**.

#### 5. **RAG Agent Path**

* The **RAG Agent** retrieves relevant information from documents using **Vector Search** (e.g., via ChromaDB).
* The LLM then generates a coherent answer from the retrieved chunks.
* The final **RAG-based response** is sent back to the user.


## **Key Features**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control**
* Users are assigned roles (e.g., HR, Finance, QA).
* Each document is tagged with the role it’s meant for.
* Queries are filtered to only retrieve content associated with the user's role.

### **2. Dual Query Handling (RAG + SQL)**
* **Unstructured queries** (e.g., "What are the QA best practices?") → handled by Chroma vector search + LLM.
* **Structured queries** (e.g., "Show me all employees with salary > 100K") → handled via DuckDB.
  
| Mode    | Triggered When              | Engine            |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **RAG** | General, text-based queries | Chroma DB + LLM   |
| **SQL** | Structured/tabular queries  | DuckDB SQL engine |


## **3. Why DuckDB for Structured Queries?**
Adopted **DuckDB** for handling structured queries on uploaded CSVs because:

* **In-process SQL engine**: DuckDB runs embedded in Python, no separate server needed.
* **Zero setup**: No configuration required; great for file-based structured queries.
* **Lightweight + Fast**: Efficiently handles large CSV files in memory.
* **Supports Pandas + SQL natively**: Easy to switch between Python dataframes and SQL.
* **Isolated query execution**: Each user session can be sandboxed.

This made DuckDB a perfect fit for answering precise, structured queries over tabular data uploaded by the user.


## **4. Query Classification Module**
A **query classifier** was implemented to determine the intent behind the user's input:

| Intent | Target System | Example Query                     |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| RAG    | Chroma + LLM  | “Summarize this finance document” |
| SQL    | DuckDB        | “List employees earning over $50k”|

* The classifier directs the query to either:
  * RAG (textual search in vector DB),
  * SQL (execute structured query using DuckDB).
This significantly **improved accuracy and speed**, avoiding LLM overhead when a SQL answer sufficed.

## **5. Fallback Handling Strategy**
In edge cases, a **fallback mechanism** is implemented:
1. If a **SQL query fails** (e.g., malformed, missing table):
   * Log the error,
   * Fallback to the RAG system with rephrased prompt like:
     *"Unable to process SQL. Try answering from available documents instead."*

2. If **no relevant docs** found in RAG:
   * Return a graceful message,
   * Suggest rephrasing or uploading new content.
This ensures the system is **resilient** and never leaves the user with a hard error.

## **6. Reranking with Cohere**
To improve relevance of retrieved documents, added a **Cohere Reranker** in the RAG flow:
* After Chroma vector search retrieves top-k chunks,
* Reranker scores them based on their semantic match with the query,
* Only top-N reranked chunks are passed to the LLM

## **7. Evaluation Framework for RAG (LLM-RAG Eval)**
An **automated evaluation pipeline** to assess output quality:

### Metrics:
* **Faithfulness**: Is the response grounded in retrieved content?
* **Relevance**: Is the answer contextually appropriate?
* **Conciseness**: Is it direct and non-redundant?

### How it works:
* Collect query-response pairs during usage
* Run them through an **OpenAI or LLM-based evaluator**
* Store per-metric scores in CSV for further analytics
* Used to compare performance with/without reranker and classifier

## **8. Automation Testing**
### **Backend API Testing – Pytest**
* FastAPI endpoints (`/chat`, `/upload`, `/login`, etc.) tested using `TestClient`
* Verified classifier routing, SQL execution, RAG fallback logic

### **Frontend Testing – Playwright**
* End-to-end tests for **Streamlit UI**:
  * Login flow
  * Role-based tab rendering
  * Document upload
  * Query submission and output display

* **Video recording** enabled for demo and review

## **Tech Stack**
 * AI/LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o, LangChain
 * Backend: FastAPI, SQLite, DuckDB
 * Frontend: Streamlit
 * Vector DB: Chroma DB
 * File Support: Markdown, CSV
 * Access Control: RBAC
 * Testing: Pytest, Playwright

## **Future Enhancements**
* Support **admin analytics dashboard** (e.g., query types, usage).
* Add **table+text hybrid retrieval** (RAG with tabular fusion).
* Caching of SQL queries for repeated execution.

## **Conclusion**
This project delivers a **production-ready RAG system** with:
* Role-based access,
* Dual-mode intelligent query routing,
* Reranking for precision,
* Automated evaluation and testing at every layer.

This RAG system demonstrates a **flexible, intelligent retrieval pipeline** that dynamically routes user queries to either unstructured (LLM-based) or structured (SQL-based) engines. The use of **DuckDB**, **query classification**, and **fallback design** has led to a robust solution that balances performance, explainability, and adaptability. With strong modularity and extensibility it’s an ideal architecture for real-world enterprise AI assistants where both document knowledge and structured analytics are needed in one place
